 # Finding patterns in policing data
DATA301 Group Project; Dashboard &amp; data visualisation of official police datasets in New Zealand. 

Proposed by Louise McMillan, 8/7/2020  

This project is about finding patterns in the publicly available data from the New Zealand Police:
https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publications-statistics/data-and-statistics/policedatanz
The NZ police have posted numerous datasets which contain data for several different types of incident, over a period of a few years. The datasets are also arranged in different ways, by individual or by incident. Most of the datasets are also labelled by territorial area and meshblock.
StatsNZ also have a wide range of datasets describing different aspects of New Zealand, including population numbers, geographical information and business, economic and cultural indicators:
https://www.stats.govt.nz/all-topics/  

These datasets can be combined to look for geographical and temporal patterns in crime statistics, and potentially to predict future patterns.
Students will need to:  
•	Integrate multiple large datasets, some fine-grained and some wide-scale  
•	Plot geographical data and/or analyse time series data  
•	Carry out an exploratory analysis, choosing a subset of variables and features to report  
•	Determine which datasets need to be integrated to answer specific questions and/or make specific predictions  
•	Carry out the analyses required to answer specific questions, and display the chosen model(s) and results  
•	Consider any ethical aspects when reporting the results
